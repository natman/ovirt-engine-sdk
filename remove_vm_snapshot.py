# Create the connection to the server:

  password='',
#  ca_file='ca.pem',
  insecure=True,

# machine:
vms_service = connection.system_service().vms_service()
vm = vms_service.list(search='name=vm_name')[0]

# Locate the service that manages the snapshots of the virtual machine:
vm_service = vms_service.vm_service(vm.id)
snaps_service = vm_service.snapshots_service()
snaps = snaps_service.list()
snap = [s for s in snaps if s.description == 'My snapshot'][0]

# Remove the snapshot:

snap_service.remove()

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close()
